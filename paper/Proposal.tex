\title{CS 350 Project Proposal}
\author{Konstantin Macarenco and Melanie Marks }
\date{February 2015}

\begin{document}

\maketitle


%Your proposal should identify:
%
%the name(s) of the student(s) working on the project;
%the choice of project topic;
%the implementation language;
%a list of the specific features that you expect to include in your final report; and
%a time plan that identifies at least 3 specific goals for each of the remaining 3 weeks of the term.
%A collaboration plan that describes how your team intends to work together.  


\noindent
\section*{Topic Choice:}
Good Sorts\\
Lots of options for algorithms.  More optimization options (pivot points, partitions, ...).  Good to learn what optimizations make the biggest differences.\\
\section*{Implementation Language:}
C/C++ with python/Bash to automate tests + profiling tools as "gprof".\\
C is fast\\
python for test programs, bash for running C on those test programs.
\section*{Expected (Possible) Features:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Find the crossover point
\item The impact of different pivot choosing methods - first vs middle vs random.
\item The impact of different partitioning algorithms - Lomuto vs Hoare.
\item Verification of results (should be simple).
\begin{itemize}
\item language or system sort comparison
\end{itemize}
\item If time allows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Java vs C++, i.e virtual machine vs low level.
\item Multithreaded vs single threaded.
%TODO all tests, for consistency, should be performed on the same machine, maybe request a dedicated time for one of the linuxlab machines?
\item GPU
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section*{Specific Goals:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Week 1  Implementation\\
Implement the quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort algorithms.\\
Make note of any interesting implementation details or implemented algorithms not in the class text.
\item Week 2  Testing \\
Create test programs
\begin{itemize}
\item sorted
\item reverse sorted
\item randomized
\end{itemize}
Run tests\\
Implement various improvements.\\
Test those improvements and document any changes in the algorithm's behavior and how their space requirements compare.\\
Make note of unexpected results, clever improvements, .. 
\item Week 3  Report \\
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Collaboration Plan: }
Along with meeting in person after class on Tuesdays and Saturday afternoons, we have also created a shared github repository for our code and are using ShareLatex for our proposal, weekly notes, and final project report.\\
How to split up work?
